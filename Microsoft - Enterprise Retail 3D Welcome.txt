      

1. Tracking Code.

This code should go on every page in the site where you want to track sharing. Please insert this code in the header section if possible. We can also provide an Async wrapper if desired.

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script> 
<script type="text/javascript">
meteor.tracking.track('c8d64a6b-b2a6-4cb0-b7e0-ab93f286e3af', {'url_storage_source': 'hash', 'query_string_tag_key': ['mtag', 'source', 'src' , 'utm_source', 'CR_CC', 'cr_cc']});
meteor.orion.init();
</script>


That's it. This will deploy Meteor and enable tracking of your site and is required on the pages in order to use rest of Meteor technologies listed below with sole exception of Pixel Conversion call detailed below. 

Please note that the Tracking code will alter the URL by appending #fbid=11 alphanumeric character which is uniquely generated per user. 


2. Conversion Tracking

Tracking conversions are very easy with Meteor Solutions. We offer the ability to name tracking events so that they are easily distinguished, giving you a great deal of flexibility in how you measure your campaign or site's effectiveness. 


1) Javascript

The preferred method of tracking conversions is to call our track_conversion() method, e.g.:

<input type="button" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('c8d64a6b-b2a6-4cb0-b7e0-ab93f286e3af',{'name':'myconversion'});">

Please change 'myconversion' to appropriate name for the conversion event.


If the conversion that you are tracking is a link (<a href=...), use the following format:


<a href="http://example.com" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('c8d64a6b-b2a6-4cb0-b7e0-ab93f286e3af',{'name':'myconversion'}, this);">


The "this" is needed to prevent the original link from firing, which can cause issues.  If you are already blocking the original link, use the "non-this" format.


2) Pixel

For tracking on third-party sites, or places where incorporating Javascript is problematic, use the pixel conversion. This is the only meteor call which does NOT require Tracking code on section 1 to be on the same page. However, this call does assume that this user within past 365 days was on a page with Tracking code:


<img src="http://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/api/conversion_pixel?cookie_name=c8d64a6b-b2a6-4cb0-b7e0-ab93f286e3af&name=myconversion" />



3. Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin Sharing

Place the following configuration call. This should be placed on the page after the Tracking call on Section 1 above.

Please note the optional parameters of 'id' and 'url'. 'id' allows multiple versions of sharing with associated parameters in this case of 'url' which will allow different shared URL.
This is useful where there are more than one item/pages being shared within a single HTML page. Additional sharing as well as configurations are possible. Please see the attached Sharing Tool API for details.

Please replace 'SET SHARING URL' below with actual URL of the desired shared page/item. Additional meteor.sharing.configure can be made with additional 'id' parameter. i.e. 'id' : 'item2'



<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
     meteor.sharing.configure('c8d64a6b-b2a6-4cb0-b7e0-ab93f286e3af', {'id': 'item1', 'url': 'SET SHARING URL'});
</script>


The actual method call to setup sharing is meteor.sharing.href with appropriate share type of 'Twitter', 'Facebook' and 'Stumbleupon'. Please see sample code below for using it with anchor tag:


<a href="#" target="_blank" onclick="this.href=meteor.sharing.href('Twitter', {'id': 'item1'});">Share on Twitter</a>


<a href="#" target="_blank" onclick="this.href=meteor.sharing.href('Facebook', {'id': 'item1'});">Share on Facebook</a>


<a href="#" target="_blank" onclick="this.href=meteor.sharing.href('Linkedin', {'id': 'item1'});">Share on LinkedIn</a>





4. Meta Headers

Each page should contain three meta headers to ensure proper operation when sharing links on Facebook and LinkedIn:

<meta name="title" content="SET TITLE" />
<meta name="description" content="SET DESCRIPTION" />
<link rel="image_src" href="SET TO URL OF IMAGE" />


These should be populated with:


Title: set content to the <title> of the page
Description: This is normally set by the SEO team, and should not be altered.
Image_src: If desired, this can be set to the URL of image to show during Facebook sharing.



5. Registering Users

Registration code:

To associate PID with Meteor's unique user id (fbid), please call the following register method.  Pass in PID such as the email or user login ID as KEY. As an example, you could call it like so:

<script type="text/javascript">
meteor.tracking.register_key("bradley@meteorsolutions.com");
</script>

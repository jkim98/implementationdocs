
1. Tracking Code.
This code should go on every page in the site where you want to track sharing.


<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script> 
<script type="text/javascript">
        meteor.tracking.track('52de88aa-d85c-40ce-9fb2-d6fd498e228c', {'url_storage_source': 'hash', 'query_string_tag_key': ['mtag', 'CR_CC', 'cr_cc']});
meteor.orion.init();
</script>


That's it. This will deploy Meteor and enable tracking of your site.

Please note that the Tracking code will alter the URL by appending #fbid=11 alphanumeric character which is uniquely generated per user. 


2. Conversion Tracking
Tracking conversions are very easy with Meteor Solutions. We offer the ability to name tracking events so that they are easily distinguished, giving you a great deal of flexibility in how you measure your campaign or site's effectiveness. 


1) Javascript
The preferred method of tracking conversions is to call our track_conversion() method, e.g.:


<input type="button" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('52de88aa-d85c-40ce-9fb2-d6fd498e228c',{'name':'myconversion'});">


e.g.: change 'myconversion2' to 'vote'


If the conversion that you are tracking is a link (<a href=...), use the following format:


<a href="http://example.com" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('52de88aa-d85c-40ce-9fb2-d6fd498e228c',{'name':'myconversion'}, this);">


The "this" is needed to prevent the original link from firing, which can cause issues.  If you are already blocking the original link, use the "non-this" format.


2) Pixel
For tracking on third-party sites, or places where incorporating Javascript is problematic, use the pixel conversion:


<img src="http://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/api/conversion_pixel?cookie_name=52de88aa-d85c-40ce-9fb2-d6fd498e228c&name=myconversion" />



3. Sharing

Based on our discussion, please integrate with Twitter and email.


Twitter with count

counturl attribute should be the base URL without meteor's fbid
url attribute should include both the base URL and fbid= 11 alphanum char  generated by Meteor's tracker.  The easiest method is to grab the entire location.href  

Optionally, adding 1 addition parameter of mtag=mbar-twitter will allow Meteor Analytical Dashboard to automatically attribute this sharing to Twitter. Example: http://areyoufast.msn.com/smokedbywindowsphone#fbid=gI2SWkK0eHE&mtag=mbar-twitter 


Email

The shared link should be the entire location.href  

Optionally, adding 1 addition parameter of mtag=mbar-email will allow Meteor Analytical Dashboard to automatically attribute this sharing to email. Example: 
http://areyoufast.msn.com/smokedbywindowsphone#fbid=gI2SWkK0eHE&mtag=mbar-email

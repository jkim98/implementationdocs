We're very excited to be working with you on this project!  


The setup process is very straightforward. Listed below, you'll find 5 easy steps to get started.
1. Tracking Code for Facebook.


Install our tracking code on any of your HTML page(s) (registration page, registration confirmation page, core page with daily offers) where you would like to track traffic. Installation is simply placing the following javascript call in your page. We recommend placing it as early as possible in the <HEAD></HEAD> section.


Facebook information re signed requests


https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/signed_request/


That's the signed request info from facebook.


Note: there were issues with the curly braces (Twitter was mis-parsing them) in a previous campaign, but if using a URL shortener (built into our sharing tool, and it happens by default), then this should not be an issue. The other alternate is to use parentheses instead of curly braces (assuming it doesn't mess up parsing).


Facebook configuration
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  meteor.tracking.set_incoming_url_id('<<fbid from signed_request>>');
  meteor.tracking.track('5c42cb42-a9bd-4494-88b5-2cd662fbc415', {
         'url_storage_source': 'hash',
         'flash_title' : false,
         'query_string_tag_key' : ['mtag','cr_cc', 'CR_CC']});
</script>
Note: for secure, change above to use:
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script>


The <<fbid from signed request>> should be filled in server-side with the value for the fbid parameter passed to the signed request.


Media Tagging (Tracking tactics)


1) the tag should look (contrived example) like:


http://facebook.com/XXXXXXXX?app_data={'mtag':'tagvalue'}


2) This should be parsed on the server, and then the following pseudo-code should be implemented (probably in javascript, since server side doesn't have access to the hash):


if (there's something in the hash):
  append &mtag=tagvalue to the hash
else:
  set the hash to mtag=tagvalue


---
That's it. This will deploy Meteor and enable tracking of your site.


We're happy to offer an API document should you desire more information on all the customizable features of Meteor's Tracker, common solutions for your own deployments, and more information on the additional tools available.


2. P3P Header
The P3P header is required for proper operation with Internet Explorer in frames.  Place:


<meta http-equiv="P3P" content='CP="IDC DSP COR ADM DEVi TAIi PSA PSD IVAi IVDi CONi HIS OUR IND CNT"'>


In the <head> section of your documents, or pass the P3P header as part of the HTTP transaction.
3. Conversion Tracking
Tracking conversions is very easy with Meteor Solutions. We offer the ability to name tracking events so that they are easily distinguished, giving you a great deal of flexibility in how you measure your campaign or site's effectiveness. 
1) Javascript
The preferred method of tracking conversions is to call our track_conversion() method, e.g.:


<input type="button" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('5c42cb42-a9bd-4494-88b5-2cd662fbc415',{'name':'myconversion2'});">


If the conversion that you are tracking is a link (<a href=...), use the following format:


<a href="http://example.com" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('5c42cb42-a9bd-4494-88b5-2cd662fbc415',{'name':'myconversion2'}, this);">


The "this" is needed to prevent the original link from firing, which can cause issues.  If you are already blocking the original link, use the "non-this" format.


2) Pixel
For tracking on third-party sites, or places where incorporating Javascript is not possible, use the pixel conversion:


<img src="http://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/api/conversion_pixel?cookie_name=5c42cb42-a9bd-4494-88b5-2cd662fbc415&name=myconversion" />




With properly deployed conversion tracking, you'll not only see how your site is contributing towards your end goals, but you'll also be able to monitor each step of your process and identify areas where you can increase your conversion ratio.  We are always happy to discuss naming and deployment strategies so that you get the most out of your deployment.


4. Customizable Sharing Toolbar


Want to give your users an easy way to spread your content? Meteor offers its Customizable Sharing Toolbar. Focused on simplicity to make sharing as easy as possible for your user, our Sharing Toolbar by default includes all the sharing information you need to seamlessly track the sharing activity of your users including the tracking id and prepared media tagging.
You can add the Sharing Toolbar by simply placing the following code on your site where you would like the Toolbar to display:


Sharing tool configuration
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metshare.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
       meteor.sharing.superbar.init({'id': '1', 'url': '<<constructed URL with signed_request>>'});
</script>


The <<constructed URL with signed_request>> value should have the fbid in it, e.g.:


http://facebook.com/12312341324134?signed_request={'fbid':'asdf1234zxc'}


The fbid can be retrieved with the following javascript method: meteor.tracking.get_id()


e.g.:


var URL = "http://facebook.com/12312341324134?signed_request={'fbid':'"+meteor.tracking.get_id()+"'}";




If for some reason you choose not to use our Sharing Toolbar, Meteor can enable your links to fully leverage its advanced tracking and reporting capabilities with a few simple Javascript calls.

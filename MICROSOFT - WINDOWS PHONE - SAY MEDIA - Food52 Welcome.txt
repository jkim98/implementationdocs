We're very excited to be working with you on this project!  


The setup process is very straightforward. Listed below, you'll find 4 easy steps to get started.


1. Tracking Code.
This code should be in each of the 3 blog posts about Windows Phone. Ideally this should be in the header of the page.




<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src=http://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/api/multi_track?application_id=5a368a14-1a37-48b8-adb3-d7040199caad&url_storage_source=hash&query_string_tag_key=mtag&query_string_tag_key=source&query_string_tag_key=src&query_string_tag_key=linkID">
</script>






That's it. This will deploy Meteor and enable tracking of your site.
2. Customizable Sharing Tracking
You can add the Meteor Sharing tracking by simply placing the following code on your site where you currently have sharing enabled.


For Food52, the following code needs to each of the 3 Food52 Blog Posts about Windows Phone. Only the email sharing will be tracked.




Sharing configuration


The following code is needed to load and setup Meteor’s Javascript library and needs to be run before the following code need to track the sharing button.


<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/ metsol.js">
</script>


<script type="text/javascript">
meteor.sharing.configure('5a368a14-1a37-48b8-adb3-d7040199caad');
</script>








The following code needs to added to existing sharing button on each of the 3 Food52 Blog Posts about Windows Phone.
 




Email


<a href="#" target="_blank" onclick="this.href=meteor.sharing.href('Email', {'id': 1', title': 'SET EMAIL SUBJECT 1', 'desc': 'SET EMAIL BODY 1'});">Share on Email</a>

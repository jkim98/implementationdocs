Portraits of Support Campaign


1. Tracking Code.

Based on mutual agreement from the technical conference call on 8/21/12, we will be using the same Meteor Trace and Tag code that is currently running on the Bank of America Corporate Responsibility site.  The only difference is the var meteorCode is unique for the Portraits of Support site.

<!-- Meteor Tagging -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">

	var meteorCode = '595dd3d1-9ce8-4e58-8033-e7473bdf7ea0';

	function meteor_TagPage() { 
	
		if( typeof (meteor.tracking.track) == 'function' && typeof (meteor.sharing.configure) == 'function') {
			
			meteor.tracking.track(
					meteorCode, 
					{
						'url_storage_source' : 'hash',
						'hash_separator' : '/',
						'hash_end' : '/',
						'query_string_tag_key' : ['mtag', 'source', 'src', 'cm_mmc']
					});
					
				meteor.sharing.configure(meteorCode);		
		}
	}

</script>

2. Conversion Tracking

Tracking conversions is very easy with Meteor Solutions. We offer the ability to name tracking events so that they are easily distinguished, giving you a great deal of flexibility in how you measure your campaign or site's effectiveness. 


1) Javascript
The preferred method of tracking conversions is to call our track_conversion() method, e.g.:


<input type="button" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('595dd3d1-9ce8-4e58-8033-e7473bdf7ea0',{'name':'myconversion'});">


e.g.: change 'myconversion' to 'vote'


If the conversion that you are tracking is a link (<a href=...), use the following format:


<a href="http://example.com" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('595dd3d1-9ce8-4e58-8033-e7473bdf7ea0',{'name':'myconversion'}, this);">


The "this" is needed to prevent the original link from firing, which can cause issues.  If you are already blocking the original link, use the "non-this" format.


2) Pixel
For tracking on third-party sites, or places where incorporating Javascript is not possible, use the pixel conversion:


<img src="http://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/api/conversion_pixel?cookie_name=595dd3d1-9ce8-4e58-8033-e7473bdf7ea0&name=myconversion" />


With properly deployed conversion tracking, you'll not only see how your site is contributing towards your end goals, but you'll also be able to monitor each step of your process and identify areas where you can increase your conversion ratio.  We are always happy to discuss naming and deployment strategies so that you get the most out of your deployment.


5. Meta Headers
Each page should contain three meta headers to ensure proper operation with external sites like Facebook:


<meta name="title" content="content" />
<meta name="description" content="content" />
<link rel="image_src" href="content" />


These should be populated with:


Title: set content to the <title> of the page
Description: This is a longer description.
Image_src: This should be set to the site/brand logo: 100x100 max size recommended.


6. Media Tagging
By seeding your campaigns with known values, we are able to give you an even more accurate picture of how your campaign is going. All we need in order to provide media tags for your display, search, seeding (blogs/forums), social network (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and content site (partner/sister sites) efforts is a list of the different sources you'd like to have tagged. Following, we'll send you a list of click-through URLs with media tags which you can seed at those various sites.


A media tag is simply a value added to the URL for your site running Meteor's tracker.  For example, if you are trying to drive traffic from your Twitter to your main page, you may want to seed a destination with a link such as:
http://www.mysite.com/index.html?mtag=twitter



Using media tags in combination opens up a world of tracking and identification. Simply add additional values to gain more insight into how your external advertising efforts are performing such as (in this particular case, paid and magazine placements):
http://www.mysite.com/index.html?mtag=paid&mtag=magazine1

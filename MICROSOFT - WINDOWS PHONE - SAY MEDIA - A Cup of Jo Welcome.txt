A Cup of Jo  http://joannagoddard.blogspot.com/


We're very excited to be working with you on this project!  


The setup process is very straightforward. Listed below, you'll find 4 easy steps to get started.


1. Tracking Code.
This code should be in each of the 3 blog posts about Windows Phone. Ideally this should be in the header of the page.




<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src=http://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/api/multi_track?application_id=5a368a14-1a37-48b8-adb3-d7040199caad&url_storage_source=hash&query_string_tag_key=mtag&query_string_tag_key=source&query_string_tag_key=src&query_string_tag_key=linkID">
</script>




That's it. This will deploy Meteor and enable tracking of your site.
2. Customizable Sharing Tracking
You can add the Meteor Sharing tracking by simply placing the following code on your site where you currently have sharing enabled.


For Cup of Jo, the following code needs to each of the 3 Cup of Jo Blog Posts about Windows Phone.


Meta tags
        
The following three meta headers are needed to ensure proper operation  for Facebook (FB) sharing by explicitly setting the description and image on FB share link button.


In addition, in order to properly test for FB shared link, the linked URL must be reachable by FB through internet (not hidden behind a private network) as FB verifies that the link is reachable before accepting it.


<meta name="title" content="content" />
<meta name="description" content="content" />
<link rel="image_src" href="content" />




These should be populated with:


Title: set content to the <title> of the Blog article
Description: This is a longer description.
Image_src: This should be set to the desired image to be on the shared link: 100x100 max size recommended.

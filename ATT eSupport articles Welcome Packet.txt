

Please remove the following code. It is not needed.

	<script type="text/javascript">	     meteor.sharing.tool('edced537-ff9a-4fc6-b05c-ee5e1387108a');	</script>


To add LinkedIn sharing button.

Currently, the eSupport site has already integrated Meteor sharing of Facebook and Twitter. The existing code on the eSupport pages looks like this:

<a href="#" title="Share this content at Twitter" onclick="window.open(meteor.sharing.href('twitter')); rpt('twitter'); return false;"><img border="0" class="vAlignMid" src="images/buttons/btn_share_Tweet.gif"  alt="Share this content at Twitter"/></a>    

In order to use LinkedIN, the above code format can be used by changing the 'twitter' sharing method in the onclick event to LinkedIN like this:

<a href="#" title="Share this content at LinkedIn" onclick="window.open(meteor.sharing.href('LinkedIn')); rpt('linkedin'); return false;"><img border="0" class="vAlignMid" src="images/buttons/btn_share_linkedin.gif"  alt="Share this content at LinkedIn"/></a> 

In addition, the following things will need to be changed:
1) src= should reflect the location and name of the actual LinkedIN icon
2) if needed, AT&T existing function rpt may need to modified to accept LinkedIn.



The current email sharing does NOT use Meteor sharing. In order to integrate Meteor tracking via email, please do the following:

1) When embedding the article URL link on the email which points back to the article, please include the part of URL which contains 'fbid=11 alphanumberic ID'. The other option is for the email application to embed the entire URL as it's shown in the URL bar which already contains 'fbid=11 alphanumberic ID'.

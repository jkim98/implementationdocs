
Bank of America - Express Your Thanks Military campaign 5/16/13

We're very excited to be working with you on this project! Please contact Rachel Ullstrom rullstrom@rioseo.com with any questions.



1. Meteor tracking Code.

The code below is the Tag and Trace component which enables tracking of social sharing by generating an 11 digit unique ID for each user and appends this ID to the URL in the browser environment. 
Ideally, this code should be placed at the header section of the every page where Meteor social tracking is desired.


1. Tracking Code.
For the Express Your Thanks Military campaign, please insert the Tracking code on the main page(s) of the site but NOT ON THE iFrame Overlay pages as that will create multiple IDs for the same user.


<!-- Meteor Tagging -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript">

	var meteorCode = 'eecae54e-4ef6-41ac-bfc9-394ad3b8d1bd';

	function meteor_TagPage() { 
		
		var browserInfo = BrowserDetect.browser+BrowserDetect.version;
		
		if (browserInfo!="Explorer7"){
			//alert(BrowserDetect.browser+BrowserDetect.version);
			if( typeof (meteor.tracking.track) == 'function' && typeof (meteor.sharing.configure) == 'function') {
				meteor.tracking.track(
						meteorCode, 
						{
							'url_storage_source' : 'hash',
							'hash_separator' : '/',
							'hash_end' : '/',
							'query_string_tag_key' : ['mtag', 'source', 'src', 'cm_mmc']
						});		
			}
		}
	}

</script>



That's it. This will deploy Meteor and enable tracking of your site.



2. Share Tool integration

Information was previously communicated to integrate the Meteor's userID into the custom Sharetool currently being used on the Bank of America Corporate Responsibility site. 



3. Conversion Tracking
Tracking conversions is very easy with Meteor Solutions. We offer the ability to name tracking events so that they are easily distinguished, giving you a great deal of flexibility in how you measure your campaign or site's effectiveness. 


1) Javascript
The preferred method of tracking conversions is to call our track_conversion() method, e.g.:


<input type="button" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('eecae54e-4ef6-41ac-bfc9-394ad3b8d1bd',{'name':'myconversion2'});">


e.g.: change 'myconversion2' to 'vote'


If the conversion that you are tracking is a link (<a href=...), use the following format:


<a href="http://example.com" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('eecae54e-4ef6-41ac-bfc9-394ad3b8d1bd',{'name':'myconversion2'}, this);">


The "this" is needed to prevent the original link from firing, which can cause issues.  If you are already blocking the original link, use the "non-this" format.
2) Pixel
For tracking on third-party sites, or places where incorporating Javascript is not possible, use the pixel conversion:


<img src="http://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/api/conversion_pixel?cookie_name=eecae54e-4ef6-41ac-bfc9-394ad3b8d1bd&name=myconversion" />


With properly deployed conversion tracking, you'll not only see how your site is contributing towards your end goals, but you'll also be able to monitor each step of your process and identify areas where you can increase your conversion ratio.  We are always happy to discuss naming and deployment strategies so that you get the most out of your deployment.



4. Media Tagging

By seeding your campaigns with known values, we are able to give you an even more accurate picture of how your campaign is going. All we need in order to provide media tags for your display, search, seeding (blogs/forums), social network (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and content site (partner/sister sites) efforts is a list of the different sources you'd like to have tagged. Following, we'll send you a list of click-through URLs with media tags which you can seed at those various sites.

Please note that the Tracker code in section 1 is already configured to pickup any value of media tags named 'cm_mmc'. 

A media tag is simply a value added to the URL for your site running Meteor's tracker.  For example, if you are trying to drive traffic from your Twitter to your main page, you may want to seed a destination with a link such as:
http://www.mysite.com/index.html?mtag=twitter



Using media tags in combination opens up a world of tracking and identification. Simply add additional values to gain more insight into how your external advertising efforts are performing such as (in this particular case, paid and magazine placements):
http://www.mysite.com/index.html?mtag=paid&mtag=magazine1

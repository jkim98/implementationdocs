We're very excited to be working with you on this project!  


The setup process is very straightforward. Listed below, you'll find 3 easy steps Specific to Word Press..


1. Activate Word-Press Plugin


In Word Press Admin interface, naviage to Plugins → Installed Plugins  and look for a plugin called “Specific CSS/JS for Posts and Pages”. Version 1.0 is currently the latest. 


If this plugin is active and working, you will see right underneath the plugin name: Deactivate | Edit. Nothing more is needed and please skip to Step 2.


Otherwise, if you see underneath the plugin name: Activate | Edit | Delete then please click on Activate. Now skip to Step 2


If you can not find a plugin called  “Specific CSS/JS for Posts and Pages” then naviage to Plugins → Installed Plugins. Keep the search plugin setting to ‘term’ and paste Specific CSS/JS for Posts and Pages  into the plugin search field and click ‘Search Plugins’ button next to it.


Specific CSS/JS for Posts and Pages should be at the top of the search results. Find it and click ‘Install Now’ 


2. Implementing Meteor’s Tag and Trace Code.
This code should be in each of the 3 blog posts about Windows Phone. 


If the blog post already exists, navigate to Posts → All Posts then click Edit, NOT Quick Edit. Otherwise create a new blog post.


Once in Edit mode, scroll all the way to the bottom. You should see a section named “Specific CSS or Javascript” (please note that it’s possible for it to be somewhere else than the bottom as it is movable).


Please copy and paste the following code into the text box right below: “Write here custom CSS or Javascript for this entry, it will be added within tags <header> “




<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src=http://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/api/multi_track?application_id=5a368a14-1a37-48b8-adb3-d7040199caad&url_storage_source=hash&query_string_tag_key=mtag&query_string_tag_key=source&query_string_tag_key=src&query_string_tag_key=linkID"></script>


<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metshare.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
        
var drawShare = function (element, config) {
    if (meteor && !meteor.missing(meteor.tracking.settings.cookie_name)) {
        var bar_id = meteor.random_id(4);
        config.node = document.createElement('div');
        config.node.id = bar_id;
        config.node.className = "meteor_share_" + config.id;
        config.node.style.position = 'relative';
        element.appendChild(config.node);
        meteor.sharing.superbar.configure(
            config, bar_id, function (json) {
                meteor.sharing.superbar.reinit(json);
            });


            //following is placeholder to customize Our Best Bites
   


    } else {
        // Recurse until track() has been called
        setTimeout(function() { drawShare(element, config); }, 500);
    }
};


jQuery(document).ready(function() {
    drawShare(document.getElementById("meteorshare"), {"id": "6"});
});


</script>


<meta name="title" content="Windows Phone 1" />
<meta name="description" content="Blog Post about Windows Phone" />
<link rel="image_src" href="http://about.jpg" />




The above three meta headers are needed to ensure proper operation for Facebook (FB) sharing by explicitly setting the description and image on FB share link button. Please change them appropriately for your site, ESPECIALLY the href = “http://about.jpg” to point to the proper location for an image to share in FaceBook.


In addition, in order to properly test for FB shared link, the linked URL must be reachable by FB through internet (not hidden behind a private network) as FB verifies that the link is reachable before accepting it.


 
That's it. This will deploy Meteor and enable tracking of your site.
3. Activating Meteor Share Buttons


You can add the Meteor Sharing Buttons by simply placing the following HTML in your blog post where you want to place the buttons. Please remember to switch your editor from Visual to HTML before entering the following code.


<div id="meteorshare"></div>




Typically this is placed either on the top of the blog post or the bottom.

We're very excited to be working with you on this project!  


The setup process is very straightforward. Listed below, you'll find 6 easy steps to get started.


1. Tracking Code.


Install our tracking code on any of your HTML page(s) (registration page, registration confirmation page, core page with daily offers) where you would like to track traffic. Installation is simply placing the following javascript call in your page. We recommend placing it as early as possible in the <HEAD></HEAD> section though this is not required.




Hashtag configuration
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
        meteor.tracking.track('0f616dc3-4333-4fd0-a4a8-cd78e07d54c2', {'url_storage_source': 'hash', 'query_string_tag_key': ['mtag', 'source']});
</script>


That's it. This will deploy Meteor and enable tracking of your site.


We're happy to offer an API document should you desire more information on all the customizable features of Meteor's Tracker, common solutions for your own deployments, and more information on the additional tools available.


2. Conversion Tracking


Tracking conversions is very easy with Meteor Solutions. We offer the ability to name tracking events so that they are easily distinguished (by renaming 'myconversion2' parameter below) giving you a great deal of flexibility in how you measure your campaign or site's effectiveness. 


1) Javascript


The preferred method of tracking conversions is to call our track_conversion() method, e.g.:


<input type="button" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('0f616dc3-4333-4fd0-a4a8-cd78e07d54c2',{'name':'myconversion2'});">


If the conversion that you are tracking is a link (<a href=...), use the following format:


<a href="http://example.com" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('0f616dc3-4333-4fd0-a4a8-cd78e07d54c2',{'name':'myconversion2'}, this);">


The "this" is needed to prevent the original link from firing, which can cause issues.  If you are already blocking the original link, use the "non-this" format.


2) Pixel


For tracking on third-party sites, or places where incorporating Javascript is not possible, use the pixel conversion:


<img src="http://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/api/conversion_pixel?cookie_name=0f616dc3-4333-4fd0-a4a8-cd78e07d54c2&name=myconversion" />


Atlas Pixel:


https://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/api/conversion_pixel?cookie_name=0f616dc3-4333-4fd0-a4a8-cd78e07d54c2&name=<insert name of UAT>


This pixel can be deployed in any Atlas Universal Action Tag (UAT).


With properly deployed conversion tracking, you'll not only see how your site is contributing towards your end goals, but you'll also be able to monitor each step of your process and identify areas where you can increase your conversion ratio.  We are always happy to discuss naming and deployment strategies so that you get the most out of your deployment.


3. Meta Headers
Each page should contain three meta headers to ensure proper operation with external sites like Facebook and LinkedIn:


<meta name="title" content="content" />
<meta name="description" content="content" />
<link rel="image_src" href="content" />


These should be populated with:


Title: set content to the <title> of the page
Description: This should be set by the SEO team, and should not be altered.
Image_src: This should be set to the image to be shared on Facebook and LinkedIn.


4. Customizable Sharing Toolbar


You can add the Sharing Toolbar by simply placing the following code on your site where you would like the Toolbar to display:


Sharing tool configuration
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
     meteor.sharing.tool('0f616dc3-4333-4fd0-a4a8-cd78e07d54c2',{'sites':'email,facebook,twitter,live'});
</script>




"href" configuration
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
     meteor.sharing.configure('0f616dc3-4333-4fd0-a4a8-cd78e07d54c2', {'id': 1, 'url': 'SET SHARING URL 1'});
</script>


then:


<a href="#" target="_blank" onclick="this.href=meteor.sharing.href('Twitter', {'url': 'SET URL HERE', 'title': 'SET SHARING TEXT'});">Share on Twitter</a>


<a href="#" target="_blank" onclick="this.href=meteor.sharing.href('Facebook', {'url': 'SET URL HERE'});">Share on Facebook</a>


<a href="#" target="_blank" onclick="this.href=meteor.sharing.href('LinkedIn', {'url': 'SET URL HERE', 'title': 'SET SHARING TEXT'});">Share on LinkedIn</a>


<a href="#" target="_blank" onclick="this.href=meteor.sharing.href('Email', {'id': 1', title': 'SET EMAIL SUBJECT 1', 'desc': 'SET EMAIL BODY 1'});">Share on Email</a>








5. Media Tagging


By seeding your campaigns with known values, we are able to give you an even more accurate picture of how your campaign is going. All we need in order to provide media tags for your display, search, seeding (blogs/forums), social network (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and content site (partner/sister sites) efforts is a list of the different sources you'd like to have tagged. Following, we'll send you a list of click-through URLs with media tags which you can seed at those various sites.


A media tag is simply a value added to the URL for your site running Meteor's tracker.  For example, if you are trying to drive traffic from your Twitter to your main page, you may want to seed a destination with a link such as:
http://www.mysite.com/index.html?mtag=twitter



Using media tags in combination opens up a world of tracking and identification. Simply add additional values to gain more insight into how your external advertising efforts are performing such as (in this particular case, paid and magazine placements):
http://www.mysite.com/index.html?mtag=paid&mtag=magazine1




6. Registering User ID




To register User ID, please call the following register method.  Pass in the userID as KEY. As an example, if the UserID is an email, you could call it like so:


<script type="text/javascript">
meteor.tracking.register_key("bradley@meteorsolutions.com");
</script>

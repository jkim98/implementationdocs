We're very excited to be working with you on this project! Please contact anna@rioseo.com with any questions.
            
General Overview

Meteor's core components are written in Javascript and designed to be called from Javascript. The main library is metsol.js which is served via Akamai CDN. 

 
1. Meteor tracking Code.

The code below is the Tag and Trace component which enables tracking of social sharing by generating an 11 digit unique ID for each user and appends this ID to the URL in the browser environment. 
Please add the following code which is designed to use 1st party cookie when used within imaginecup.com and any subdomain sites. Ideally, this code should be placed at the header section of the every page where Meteor social tracking is desired.

<!-- Meteor tracking and configuration code in header --> 
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metsol.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/metlike.js"></script>
<script src="http://static.meteorsolutions.com/metshare.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
meteor.tracking.track('7326c30a-baf2-4de2-bb5b-9df6b8518777', {'url_storage_source': 'hash', 'query_string_tag_key': ['mtag', 'source', 'src', 'cr_cc', 'CR_CC', 'cm_mmc']});
meteor.orion.init();
var likeconfig = {'fblike':
                {'enabled': 'true', 'send': 'false', 'layout': 'button_count' },
              'twtweet':
                {'enabled': 'true', 'related': '@Skype'}
             };
meteor.sharing.liketool.init(likeconfig);
</script>      
                   
That's it. This will deploy Meteor and enable tracking of your site and must execute first on a page in order to utilize the rest of Meteor technologies listed below with sole exception of Pixel Conversion call detailed below. 
   


2. Share Tool Implementation

There are 2 different set of sharing tool code presented below. The first set is for the floating share tool on the left side of the screen.  The second set is for Facebook like with count and Twitter follow with count to be displayed on the the top right side of the screen.


# Floating Share Tool on the left side of screen

Please insert the following code into the body section of the HTML.

<script>
        meteor.sharing.superbar.init({'id': '1', 'device': 'mobile', 'size': 'mobile-small', 'sites' : ['twitter', 'email', 'facebook', 'linkedin']});
</script>
 
 
If present on the page, Meteor share tool will automatically use the value of HTML <title> tag to set the title of Facebook sharing and email subject and meta name="description" content will be used for Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin shared messages and the email body text. 

Optionally, title and/or message can be explicitly set which will override the value of HTML <title> and meta name="description" by adding parameters of 'title' and/or 'message' to meteor.sharing.superbar.init call in the section above. 

Please see "Superbar Documentation 11_16_12 Release" for further details and configuration options.
 
  
  
# Facebook like with count and Twitter follow with count

The configuration for both of these are set above in the code shown under 1. Meteor tracking Code and specifically in var likeconfig =. The included configuration is already set to mimic the Facebook Like and Twitter follow already on the Blog Page.

For further documentation and complete configuration options, please see https://app.meteorsolutions.com/sites/1034/like_help/


To implement, please place the following div tag with this class name where you desire the Twitter follow with count to render.

<div class="meteor:fblike"></div>


To implement, please place the following div tag with this class name where you desire the Facebook like with count to render.

<div class="meteor:twtweet"></div>






Conversion/End-Action Tracking

We offer the ability to name tracking events so that they are easily distinguished, giving you a great deal of flexibility in how you measure your campaign or site's effectiveness.

***In all cases - please rename 'myconversion' to a conversion name appropriate for a specific end action i.e. 'whitepaper1_download', 'register_page1', 'watch_welcomeVideo'


Option One -  Javascript  (The preferred method of tracking conversions) 

This calls our track_conversion() method

<input type="button" onClick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('7326c30a-baf2-4de2-bb5b-9df6b8518777',{'name':'myconversion'});">
_____


HREF  Javascript Configuration
(use for conversion that are links (<a href=...))

<a href="http://example.com" onclick="meteor.tracking.track_conversion('7326c30a-baf2-4de2-bb5b-9df6b8518777',{'name':'myconversion'}, this);">
***The "this" is needed to prevent the original link from firing, which can cause issues. If you are already blocking the original link, use the "non-this" format.


Option Two -  Pixel

For tracking on third-party sites, or places where incorporating Javascript is not possible, use the pixel conversion:

<img src="http://cdnt.meteorsolutions.com/api/conversion_pixel?cookie_name=7326c30a-baf2-4de2-bb5b-9df6b8518777&name=myconversion" />
